Dear Cyrille,

I would like to point you to my github.com repository (https://github.com/jamesee/SUTD/tree/main/Javascript/2021-07-06) for the submission of homework. I think it would be easier for you to read the codes via github.

Please see the markdown Submissions-20210706.md and click on the links to scrimba.com

The codes for activity1 are in the folder "activity1". You can see the demo at https://jamesee.github.io/SUTD .

For the snippets of classroom exercises, I have consolidated them into a single file "consolidated-snippets.js" as per your instruction.

Thank you.


Yours sincerely,
James Ee
