Dear Cyrille,

Please see my github.com repository (https://github.com/jamesee/SUTD/tree/main/Javascript/2021-07-13) for the submission of homework.

Please see the markdown file "Submissions-20210713.md" and click on the links to scrimba.com

For the snippets of classroom exercises, I have consolidated them into a single file "consolidated-snippets.js" as per your instruction.

Thank you.


Yours sincerely,
James Ee
